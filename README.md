# Tetch_spanishTeacherChatbot
This is a simple chatbot that was made to teach users to write/read in Spanish. This is an updated version based on the one made as part of a uni group project.
This version was made completely from scratch without looking at my prior teammates code, months later.

In the original version, I made all the activities, and did the research for them. I offered ideas and input for the other parts of the program.
activities.py was also rewritten for this version, along with everything else.
